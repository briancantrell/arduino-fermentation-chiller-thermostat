# Arduino Fermentation Chiller Thermostat
## Homebrewing on the Internet of Things

This is the Arduino sketch I use to run my fermentation chiller thermostat that logs to Cosm. If you are building something similar it might be a good place to start your design and save you some time. Much of the code is repurposed from other places which might be helpful to you.
